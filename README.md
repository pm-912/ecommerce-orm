## Description
  This is a simple application that combines MYSQL and Express,
  allowing for manipulation of data in an e-commerce company's 
  back end. Users can view, create, update, and delete data associated
  with Products and their related Tags and Categories.
  
## Usage
  The application is initialized by creating the databse in MYSQL, 
  then seeding it with data. When the server is connected, one can use various http requests to Get, Post, Put, or Delete the data.
  
## Installation
  The application uses Node.JS, Dotenv, Express, MYSQL2, and
  Sequelize.
